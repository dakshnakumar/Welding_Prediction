# Welding_Prediction
web app for predicting outcome of welding using machine learning 

Developed web app for predicting outcome of welding. This web app will be very useful for welder , by knowing the outcome of the welding before he actually do the welding process. 

# Input : Humidity,Temperature,Current,Flow,Job Temperature,Voltage
# Output : with defect or without defect

While traning machine learning model , used all the necesaary preprocessing technique , examined machine learning models like Randomforest , KNN , Suppport vector machine(SVM) and many more after traning deployed in web , used python as backend
