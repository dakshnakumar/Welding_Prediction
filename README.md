# Welding_Prediction
web app for predicting outcome of welding using machine learning 

Developed web app for predicting outcome of welding. This web app will be very useful for welder , by knowing the outcome of the welding before he actually do the welding process. While traning machine learning model , used all the necesaary preprocessing technique , examined machine learning models like Randomforest , KNN and SuppportVectorMachine(SVM) after traning deployed in web.

Dataset:
Due to industry terms and conditions , i cannot able to share the dataset.
